# Artifact Cpp
Written in C++, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS. The program needs exactly three integers as arguments (./artifact <N> <mvmt> <cond>). 
Specifically, N: the amount of artifacts, mvmt: The movement of the artifacts (0:Impessionism, 1:Expressionism, 2:Naturalism) 
and cond: The condition of the artifacts (0:Bad, 1:Good, 2:Excellent)
Contains makefile: make to compile, make clean to delete object files and executable and make check to check if there are memory leaks.
